This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.11.5-MariaDB-log source revision: 7875294b6b74b53dd3aaa723e6cc103d2bb47b2c
key_buffer_size=134217728
read_buffer_size=2097152
max_used_connections=4
max_threads=102
thread_count=4
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 760442 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

Thread pointer: 0x7f7444437e88
Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
Cannot determine thread, fp=0x7f744428faa0, backtrace may not be correct.
Stack range sanity check OK, backtrace follows:
0x5606f1d9f615
0x7f746b0fed07
Stack trace seems successful - bottom reached
Please read http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/resolve-stack-dump.html
and follow instructions on how to resolve the stack trace.
Resolved stack trace is much more helpful in diagnosing the
problem, so please do resolve it
